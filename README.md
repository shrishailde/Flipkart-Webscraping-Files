Creating My Own Dataset By Web Scraping Flipkart.com using Python and Beautiful Soup Library

This repo is for my [blogpost](https://shrishailde.github.io/post/Webscraping-Flipkart-Excel-Postgres). 

Brief: Created my own dataset of different headphone products by scraping flipkart.com using Python and Beautiful Soup library. 
Saved the dataset in excel as well as PostgreSQL table programatically.

Files info:
1) `Webscrapping N1.ipynb`: Notebook created to understand the html page layout in order to extract desired product attributes.
2) `main.py`: Final script to scrape the search result pages obtained to create the dataset.
